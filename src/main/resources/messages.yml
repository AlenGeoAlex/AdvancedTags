##The plugin utilizes the Iridium Color API, It will support Hex Colors on servers higher than 1.15.
##If the native server version does not support it,
##The plugin will automatically try to convert all your text to the legacy color codes.
##The usage of the color codes has been described on the Github Wiki of Iridium Color API. (Link Below)
